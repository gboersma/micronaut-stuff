+ Integrate Quartz.
+ Add enabled property to enable / disable Quartz.
+ Create new Jobs as Micronaut beans, so the jobs can use all Micronaut features.
+ Demonstrate that job beans can do JPA, with no transaction boundary issues like Spring.
+ Add some builder helpers- slightly more concise syntax for getting builders.
+ Manage quartz properties in application.yml
- Map Quartz properties to Micronaut properties e.g. JPA database connection properties

Later:
- Track down where Quartz uses Java reflection, and investigate how to replace.
-- Can provide own implementation of SchedulerFactory that does not use reflection.
- Ability to delete all existing jobs and re-create them.
-- Solves issues with old jobs / triggers refiring / Java serialization.
-- Need to figure out how to have one server do this, and not all servers.
-- Some sort of job versioning?
