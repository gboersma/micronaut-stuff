Break this into modules:
- job-scheduler: Mechanism for scheduling jobs across a cluster (i.e. Quartz replacement), query/manage the schedule.
- job-audit: Get all the details for jobs that are running / have run.
- job-logging: Support for logging for jobs
- job-rest: Rest controllers for accessing the jobs / schedule.
- job-ui: Static pages for accessing REST service.
- examples
-- hello-scheduler: application that schedules jobs across multiple instances in cluster.

Clients can include the components that they want to use.

Review Quartz and come up with design for scheduler.
